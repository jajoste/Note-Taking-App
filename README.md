# Note-Taking-App

This project uses Jinja2 and Flask as a framework to build a basic note taking app.

## Overview:
1. Clone repo and install the requirements listed in requirements.txt 
`git clone <repo-url>`
`pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Launch the app by running main.py
`python main.py`
3. View the app from:
`http://127.0.0.1:5000`

## Through this project I have learned about:
1. Databases: relational and non-relational databases. How they are built, how to model them, 
and how data can be accessed, updated and stored via user input on the front-end
2. How to create a webiste using the MVC (model view controller) method. Allowing for the logic,
and what the user interacts with to be edited separately and controlled from elsewhere using Flask
3. How to use Flask to create a simple web application
4. How to use Jinja2, a HTML templating language using python, to inherit different page views 
based on a template HTML file
5. How Stylesheets can be used to style the front end of a website and make it more user friendly. Using 
Bootstrap's template CSS files and creating a custom styling sheet with custom classes
6. How to use git as a version control tool, and how to commit and push changes to GitHub

## Reflections:
1. This project has shown me how pivotal JavaScript is to web development - and that to get dynamic websites, a tech stack built on JavaScript is the sensible solution. JavaScript is also more efficient than Python when it comes to compiling the project. The MERN stack looks like a good framework for web development.

## Suggestions for what to do next:
1. Learn JavaScript and MERN Stack web development
2. Continue using Flask and Jinja2 and create a more complex application such as a Bug Manager used in industry by Software Engineers
